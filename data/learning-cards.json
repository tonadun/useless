      "steps": [
        "Review the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) for specific procedures and oil specifications",
        "Perform safety lockout/tagout procedures to ensure the engine cannot be started",
        "Position the aircraft over a drip pan or oil collection system to catch waste oil",
        "Remove the oil drain plug and allow the oil to drain completely (usually 30-45 minutes)",
        "Inspect the drained oil for metal particles or contamination that might indicate engine problems",
        "Replace the drain plug with a new crush washer and torque to specification (typically 25-35 ft-lbs)",
        "Remove and inspect the oil filter, checking for metal particles",
        "Install a new oil filter and safety wire it according to regulations",
        "Add the specified type and quantity of aviation-grade oil (turbine engines typically use MIL-PRF-23699 synthetic oil)",
        "Check oil level using the dipstick or sight gauge",
        "Run the engine at idle for a leak check",
        "Document the oil change in the aircraft logbook with date, oil type, quantity, and mechanic signature"
      ],
      "funFact": "A typical commercial jet engine holds 5-8 gallons of oil, but unlike your car, it's normal for aircraft engines to consume some oil during operation. That's why pilots check oil levels before every flight!",
      "keyTakeaway": "Aircraft maintenance requires extreme precision and documentation. Every step is verified, double-checked, and recorded because lives depend on it."

        "Hold the knife with a pinch grip: thumb and index finger grip the blade, other fingers wrap the handle",
        "Create a claw grip with your non-knife hand: fingertips curl back, knuckles guide the blade",
        "Master the rocking motion: keep the knife tip on the cutting board, rock the blade up and down",
        "Learn the cross-chop technique: for herbs, use one hand on the knife handle, other on the spine",
        "Practice the julienne cut: square off the vegetable, cut into thin planks, stack and cut into matchsticks",
        "Perfect the brunoise: take julienned pieces and dice into 1-2mm cubes",
        "Develop consistent sizing: uniform cuts ensure even cooking times",
        "Maintain your knife: hone before each use with a steel, sharpen regularly with a whetstone",
        "Keep your cutting board stable: place a damp towel underneath to prevent slipping",
        "Clean and store properly: wash by hand immediately, store in a knife block or magnetic strip"

        "Gather information: Ask when the problem started and what was happening at the time",
        "Identify the symptoms: complete loss of power, intermittent issues, or specific outlets affected",
        "Check the obvious: Inspect the circuit breaker for tripping, look for GFCI reset buttons",
        "Use a non-contact voltage tester to confirm power is truly off before touching anything",
        "Visually inspect outlets and switches for burn marks, loose connections, or damage",
        "Use a multimeter to test voltage: should read 120V for standard US outlets, 0V when off",
        "Check continuity: with power OFF, test if the circuit path is complete from breaker to outlet",
        "Inspect wire connections in junction boxes for loose or corroded connections",
        "Test individual components: outlets, switches, and light fixtures may need replacement",
        "Look for overloaded circuits: too many devices on one circuit can cause repeated tripping",
        "Check for ground faults: wet areas, damaged insulation, or rodent damage can cause problems",
        "Once the issue is identified and fixed, restore power and test thoroughly",
        "Document the problem and solution for future reference"
      ],
      "funFact": "Electricians follow a logical troubleshooting flow because electricity is invisible. They rely on tools and systematic testing rather than guessing, which saves time and prevents dangerous mistakes.",
